We promote educational approaches that utilize project-focused and culturally responsive pedagogy.

Our work often includes a close examination of the student experience. We see this as essential to our ability to offer recommendations that can make a true difference in a school or collegeâ€™s educational strengths. Our team works with institutions to build programs rooted in their vision for student learning, informed by a close examination of life in classrooms and latest research in the field.

Areas of work include project-based learning, service-learning, ELL and bilingual programs, special education services, school and program design, educational leadership, programs in support of equity and inclusion, and challenges with disproportionality in special education.
