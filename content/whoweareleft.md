We live in diverse world with evolving definitions of expertise and success. Schools and colleges at all levels must employ curricular design and teaching methods that help students move toward professional success and personal well-being in a constantly changing environment. We offer professional development to educational institutions that is guided by evidence-based practices that foster mutual understanding and achievement of organizational objectives. We also conduct applied research in support of the development and fulfillment of institutional goals â€“ examining the student experience and social relationships among all members of educational organizations.
