VEC is an interdisciplinary team of school leaders and teachers providing a range of consulting services to schools and colleges. Bill, Claudia, and Jim each approach their work with a common sense of purpose but very different experience. We work with educational innovators to ensure that new models of schooling sustain student learning in a fluid, changing world.
