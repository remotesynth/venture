We believe that curriculum design should be paired with thoughtful design of the leader/faculty and teacher/student relationship. The school is an inhabited world. The experience of this environment defines and shapes the habits and competencies that are valued. We work with schools to re-define these relationships away from a relationship of control toward one of mutual ownership of learning. How leaders co-develop a culture and how they view the ongoing development of individuals and the organization are key to student engagement. How students and teachers interact must be understood as part of the fabric of a curriculum and its learning objectives. A productive learning relationship at all levels is built around an understanding of each student and how they engage with curricular content and the surrounding environment that leads to learning.
