Democracy requires informed and active citizens who view difference as a source of strength, leading to new and more developed ideas. Schools and colleges should prepare young people to make the important decisions of a citizen by creating opportunities for meaningful agency on the part of the student. We help guide this work by promoting research-based educational approaches that use project-focused, collaborative pedagogy, that is culturally and linguistically response and informed by data. The results produce engaged innovative leaders, responsive educators, and engaged students ready for future careers.
