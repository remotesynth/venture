VEC is an interdisciplinary team of school leaders and teachers providing a range of consulting services to schools and colleges. Bill, Claudia, and Jim each approach their work with a common sense of purpose but very different experience. We work with educational innovators to ensure that new models of schooling sustain student learning in a fluid, changing world. We help build innovative programs, through responsive, student-centered design. Representing broad experience teaching and leading schools and colleges from elementary through graduate school, our team works with institutions to build programs rooted in their vision for student learning, informed by a close examination of the student experience.

## Vision

We work with clients to realize and define a future vision for their work. We believe that effective implementation grows out of fundamental coherence, clarity and agreement around the future vision. Through this visioning work, we push clients to wrestle with the student experience and external demands.
 
## New Direction

Any new direction must be defined down to the level of student experience and the desired actions of everyone and made tangible through clear definitions of success.
 
## Student experience

All of our work begins from a close examination of the student experience within existing or designed learning environments. We see this as essential to yielding results for any project that will make a true difference in preparation for college, career, and citizenship.
