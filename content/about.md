VEC is an interdisciplinary team of school leaders and teachers providing a range of consulting services to schools and colleges. Bill, Claudia, and Jim and their colleagues have very different professional backgrounds but approach their work with a common sense of purpose. We work with schools, school districts, and colleges to ensure that educational environments sustain the most positive and productive experiences, supporting diverse populations of students for future success.

Our team brings expertise in areas including ELL and bilingual students with and without disabilities, MTSS (Multi-Tiered Systems of Support), UDL (Universal Design for Learning), special education services, disproportionality, school and program design, educational leadership, project-focused learning, service-learning, and quantitative and qualitative research methods.

We offer an external perspective that helps stakeholders consider new ways of collaborating, understanding current practice, and strategic planning. Given the complex dynamics and potential impact of relationships in schools on learning, gaining perspective on the nature of these relationships is essential to optimizing academic achievement.

## Consultants

Mr. Wilmot received his B.A. in Liberal Arts, from St. John's College in Annapolis, MD, with a focus on philosophy and the history of science and math. He earned an Ed.M. in School Leadership, specializing in School Development from Harvard Graduate School of Education. He is currently a consultant working with CAST on the implementation of the Universal Design for Learning framework. Prior to that, he was the Founding Head of School at Tremont School, a project-based school focused on academic, social, and emotional learning as three equal parts of school. He approached designing a school with the goal of making school fit students rather than students fitting schools. Before that he was the second Head of School for four years of the Seacoast Charter School, an arts-integrated, K-8 charter school. He began his career teaching math, science, and music in grades 5-9 in a variety of charter and district schools. He has also worked as a consultant for public, charter pilot, and independent schools, including school design and redesign, program evaluation, and strategic planning. He has written about leadership, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) implementation, and learning design. In all of his work, his goal is to transform the relationship between students and teachers toward mutual learning, building a sense of ownership for students over their learning.

## Vision

We work with clients to realize and define a future vision for their work. We believe that effective implementation grows out of fundamental coherence, clarity and agreement around the future vision. Through this visioning work, we push clients to wrestle with the student experience and external demands.

## New Direction

Any new direction must be defined down to the level of student experience and the desired actions of everyone and made tangible through clear definitions of success.

## Student experience

All of our work begins from a close examination of the student experience within existing or designed learning environments. We see this as essential to yielding results for any project that will make a true difference in preparation for college, career, and citizenship.
