EC is an interdisciplinary team of school leaders and teachers. Bill, Claudia, and Jim each approach with a common sense of purpose but very different experience. Our practice is focused on working with schools and colleges to build programs that integrate curricular and pedagogical design within an engaged and responsive innovative educational thinking to learning.  Representing broad experience teaching and leading schools and colleges from elementary through graduate school, our team works with institutions to structure programs and processes based upon a close examination of the student experience. We specialize in learner-centered critique and redesign of systems to sustain learning within a fluid, changing world.

## Vision

We work with clients to realize and define a future vision for their work. We believe that ineffective implementation grows out of underlying disagreement in the future vision. Through this visioning work, we push clients to wrestle with the student experience and external demands.
 
## New Direction

Any new direction must be defined down to the level of student experience and made tangible through clear definitions of success.
 
## Student experience

All of our work begins from a close examination of the student experience within existing
or designed learning environments. We see this as essential to yielding results
for any project that will make a true difference in preparation for college,
career, and citizenship.
